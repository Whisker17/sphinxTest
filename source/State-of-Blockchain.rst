State of Blockchain
*******************************************************************************

The industry has spoken, the blockchain platforms of today, and as they are currently built, are not fit for scale or speed, they continue to lack security and they are not designed for the masses in the developer community.

We have all heard of the problems within the ever expanding blockchain space. The fact that scalability isn¡¯t just the giant elephant in the room, it¡¯s that elephant that has taken over the room. They are slow. Security ¨C one needs to look no further than the recent events of not just (Initial Coin Offerings) ICO¡¯s being hacked but exchanges, wallets and entire systems as well. The blockchain space is not for everyone - there a limited few developers in the world today that can build upon any of the existing blockchains.

Imagine if there were a solution that provided the scalability that we all know this sector needs, we¡¯re not talking about 10, 100, or even a thousand transactions being processed per second. What if there was a blockchain that could run a minimum of 40,000 transactions per second with future enhancements that are even higher? What if there were a secure and fundamentally sound platform, built upon the lessons learned from initial efforts of Bitcoin and Ethereum that would allow developers of all mediums and categories to build on that platform? What if that platform were built not on proof of work but proof of stake? Yes ¨C we¡¯ve heard the rumors about groups coming out with bits and pieces of those solutions but there simply isn¡¯t one that can promise all that and be less than a year to market.

Until now.
